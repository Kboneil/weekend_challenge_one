The project name is "Employee Records" that keeps track of different employee information.

## Features

There is a form that takes in information and appends that to the DOM, in a table feature, when a submit button is clicked.

### Feature One

When a row of information is added, a delete button also appears that will remove the entire row when clicked.

### Feature Two

There is also a feature that divides the salaries of each employee by twelve (to get the monthly salary) and then adds each employee's salary together for total monthly expenditures. It also removes a salary from the total when a row is deleted. 

### Feature Three

I enjoy playing around with CSS, so I styled up the page a little more, especially on the form part.
